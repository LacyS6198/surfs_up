# Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze weather data in Oahu to determine if opening a surf shop is sustainable thoughout the year. 

The profitability of surf shops are highly dependent on the weather. The shop needs to be located in an area that has enough rain to keep the area tropical and vegetation lush, but not too much that it deters surfers. The temperature must also be warmer to encourage surfing and people at the beach. If the location has too many rainy days, or too many colder-weather days, there will not be enough customers to sustain the Surf Shop. 

Throughout this module, the precipitation in Oahu was analyzed. The analysis done in the Module 9 Challenge is specifically to compare the temperature in June against those in December to determine whether there are enough warm-weather days throughout the year to keep the shop open year-round.

# Results
This section details the key results from the analysis.

## Summary Statistics
Below are the summary statistics for the months of June and December. Data includes all values for the given month, including all days and all years, that were available in the data set.

## Key Observations/Differences
From the summary statistics, we can see three main differences between the temperatures for June and December. 

 - The average temperature for December is 3 degrees lower than in June
 - The minimum temperature in December is 56 while the minimum in June is 64
 - The quartile temperatures (25%, 50%, 75%) are only 3 - 4 degrees different between June and December
