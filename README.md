# Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze weather data in Oahu to determine if opening a surf shop is sustainable thoughout the year. 

The profitability of surf shops are highly dependent on the weather. The shop needs to be located in an area that has enough rain to keep the area tropical and vegetation lush, but not too much that it deters surfers. The temperature must also be warmer to encourage surfing and people at the beach. If the location has too many rainy days, or too many colder-weather days, there will not be enough customers to sustain the Surf Shop. 

Throughout this module, the precipitation in Oahu was analyzed. The analysis done in the Module 9 Challenge is specifically to compare the temperature in June against those in December to determine whether there are enough warm-weather days throughout the year to keep the shop open year-round.
